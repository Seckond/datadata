# Data, data
## A statistical analysis and exploration on Jorge Drexler's music and lyrics.

### by [Alex Ingberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexingberg/)



Data, data is a homage to the great Uruguayan musician and songwriter [Jorge Drexler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU9gzRy2dQc).


Pulling data using both the Genius API and the Spotify API I've been able to analyze Jorge's music and get some insights and visualizations on his creative process and his songs in general; both from the lyrics side and the musical theory side.

Wordcount, lexical and lyrical density, sentiment analysis and analysis of musical components like tempo, time signature and key are all taken into account. Also, in the end, [gloom_index](https://www.rcharlie.com/post/fitter-happier/) is used combining both lyrics and music.

Some cool samples from the visualizations:

![Tempo by albums](img/tempo_by_albums.jpg?raw=true "Tempo by albums")
![Usage of keys](img/keys.jpg?raw=true "Usage of keys")
![Top 10 songs with more words](img/top_songs_more_words.jpg?raw=true "Top 10 songs with more words")
![Wordcloud](img/wordcloud.jpg?raw=true "Wordcloud")
![Lyrical density vs lexical density](img/lyrical_density_v_lexical_density.jpg?raw=true "Lyrical density vs lexical density")
![Correlation in negative NRC emotions](img/correlation_in_emotions.jpg?raw=true "Correlation in negative NRC emotions")

This whole project has been created using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and a little bit of [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

I created the databases with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (an amazing Python wrapper for the Web Spotify API), and the [Genius API](https://genius.com/developers) and [Web Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

To work on the analysis the tools I used were [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/), [wordcloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) and [py-lex](https://github.com/dropofwill/py-lex).
